000011 Hello. MC theory can be used not only between clouds, but also to optimise final glide.
000069 We are 55km from destination. PDA shows that on MC 0 setting, glider is about 350 meters too low to reach finish.
000132 Lets gain altitude in thermal.
000331 In order to optimise final glider, set MC setting at climb rate in last thermal.
000442 In this case it is at least 2m/s.
000647 Setting MC 2.0 leads to change of arrival altitude to over -700 meters.
000735 However with climb rate 2m/s, that 400 additional meters will take 3 minutes and 20 seconds to get. And flying at least 50km/h faster on 55km distance will save a lot more time.
001036 Lets focus now on thermalling.
001366 500 meters still needed...
001493 But on MC 0, we could now leave thermal and try to get to finish line.
001871 It is good to know about predicted arrival altitudes at different MC settings.
001938 When flying at certain MC speed, and sink leaves you without enough altitude, reducing speed to MC0 can save final glide without need to find lift again.
002250 Whole process of looking for lift, entering it, finding core of thermal is taking time. It is not worth for 100 meters of altitude. 
002527 To show it - we are leaving thermal too early. We can get to finish flying little slower, with MC 1.1 setting.
002714 But margin of 20 meters over 55 km glide can be risky.
002793 However, flying at MC0 gives over 360 meters safety margin.
003222 There is higher terrain in front of us. Additional altitude can be nessesery.
003357 Flying not directly to destination is leading to loss of range.
003658 Some thermal would be nice..
003884 There it is...
004162 It is going to be over 2m/s, so once again set MC 2.0 and climb high enough to get DDH letting us to get to the finish point.
005837 DDH is over 0, there are many nice clouds ahead in case of trouble. There is big chance that this final glide will be fast.
