<P>When circling in the last thermal of the task, the pilot usually asks himself 
how high to climb. This is of course important for him to reach the airfield. 
But when racing,&nbsp;the height of departure from the last thermal has also a 
big influence on the time it takes to reach the finish point.</P>
<P>Again, MC theory does the job. We set the MC to the rate of climb we 
currently have. The&nbsp;computer will assume that when leaving the thermal, you 
will fly with the speed that corresponds to that MC setting. Given the estimated 
speed, the computer can compute the estimated glide ratio and as it also knows 
the distance to the finish point it can also compute the optimal height to leave 
the thermal.</P>
<P>Our final glide computer is found on the Ipaq screen 3. The red dot shows the 
height at which we will cross the finish line if we will fly with the speed that 
corresponds to the current MC setting - assuming the air will be still&nbsp;in 
our final glide. If the dot is below the screen center, we are higher that 
required and vice versa.</P></BODY></HTML>
