<P>When trying to maximize your cross-country average speed, you come to the 
question of how fast to fly between thermals. You can fly fast to reach the next 
thermal as quick as possible, but you will lose a lot of height that will have 
to be gained back in the next thermal. On the other hand, you can fly slowly and 
preserve your height, but you will loose too much time to reach the thermal.</P>
<P>The problem was solved by Paul McCready and his theory is called MC theory. 
It says that the optimal speed to fly between the thermals is the same as the 
speed of best glide when flying through sinking air with vertical speed that is 
equal to the rate of climb in the next thermal. Sounds complicated?</P>
<P>Today we luckily have computer instruments on board of every modern glider 
that show us how fast to fly. There is one important thing that the pilot must 
estimate himself though: the expected rate of climb&nbsp;in the next thermal. 
This rate of climb is usually called MC setting. If we expect 2 m/s climb, we 
set the MC to 2.0 and the computer will output the optimal speed to fly. </P>
<P>One would expect that the optimal speed to fly remains constant till we 
change the MC setting. It is indeed the case in still air. But if we fly through 
the air that moves either vertically or horizontally, then the optimal speed 
will change. But the pilot has nothing to worry about as the computer does the 
job - the pilot only follows the given speed.</P>
<P>We can switch from vario to "speed command" with the default&nbsp;RIGHT CTRL 
key. The vario needle will then show if we are flying too fast or too slow. If 
the needle shows up, we are flying too fast and vice versa. To relieve the pilot 
from watching the vario all the time, the sound signal is also emitted. If we are 
too fast,&nbsp;the tone&nbsp;is high, if we are to slow, the tone is low and if 
we have the right speed, the vario becomes quiet.</P></BODY></HTML>
