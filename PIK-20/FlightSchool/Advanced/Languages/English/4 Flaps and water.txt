000024 Hello, change of glider today!
000112 This is high performance Antares 18S. Equipped with flaps and filled with water ballast.
000186 Let's see how flaps setting influences performance on cruise.
000304 Setting them up increases glide ratio at high speed, at cost of lower lift coefficient.
000440 Extending flaps down at high speed lowers performance.
000576 During stable flight there is one optimal flap setting for one speed and wing loading. Flaps can be moved up with 'F' key and down with 'V' key.
000700 Flaps extedned down are mainly used for climbing in thermals.
000859 That cumulus looked nice. We expect thermal at the end of cloud.
001022 There it is...
001088 Usually setting flaps to the lowest position is pointless for straight flight, even slow one. But extra lift is suitable in thermalling.
001170 Flaps allow us to climb at only 90km/h - this allows to fit in thermal and use it core.
001288 It would not be possible with flaps up...
001403 Glider immediately gets faster and increases radious of circle.
001500 Water ballast works differently. High wing loading moves glider polar to higher speeds. It means that glide ratio is the same but at higher velocity.
001598 You can fill ballast before flight and during soaring only drop it.
001694 Pressing 'W' key opens water valves and clicking it again closes them. It depends on glider but usually dumping full ballast takes about 4 minutes.
001798 You can't see water trail from inside. It evaporates too quick. Using clock is good to estimate when to close opened valves.
002207 Better performance on cruise comes at cost of higher speed in thermals - it makes climbing harder. Therefore it's cruicial to estimate correctly how heavy should be glider for current thermal conditions.
