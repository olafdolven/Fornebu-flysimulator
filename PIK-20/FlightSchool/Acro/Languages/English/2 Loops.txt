000020 Hello, today quick fun lesson. Loops.
000067 Duo Discus is not aerobatic glider, but loops can be done smoothly. At first speed up to about 200km/h.
000151 Level flight, keeping around 200km/h. Then pull stick back. 
000189 Remember not to loose too much speed on top of the loop.
000232 Keep wings level during whole manouver. Artificial horizon gauge can help with orientation while inverted.
000351 Once again. 200km/h, level flight, stick backward, watch airspeed, loop done, keep level flight.
000597 If navigation helpers are enabled, You can tick acro box to be set over airfield.
000757 Wingtip smokes can make acro training more effective, and much more fun.
000786 That smoke can be enabled with 'T' key by default.
000868 Let's make loop with wingtip smoke.
