000027 Hello, today we are too low and far from cumulus clouds so outlanding lesson awaits.
000098 When altitude drops under 500 meters and there are no obvious lifts nearby, flying near safe fields should be priority.
000200 There some fields ahead.
000309 There are some steps to decide what field is good to land on.
000363 1. Size - glider should fit in with rolling. Remember that obstacles are making it harder. Field should be roughly 20 meters longer for each meter of obstacle on edge.
000450 2. Slope and wind. On flat fields always land against the wind, on hilly ones - against the slope.
000555 There is some 15km/h wind from direction 100-120 degrees.
000639 So now it is basically headwind.
000723 That area is not suitable to outland at all...
000763 And some fields can be found there
000859 This one is big enough, but landing would be with crosswind, against hill.
000982 Important is not to change mind under certain altitude. Let's set 300 meters for 'decision height'. Under it, only outlanding manouvers are done.
001101 That fields are small and not so flat...
001181 And this is againt wind, but smaller than first field.
001435 We dropped below 300 meters. Gear down and quick decision about field!
001637 When landing against wind, small field has some trees on final. Better option is bigger one.
001855 When landing uphill, final will be clear from any trees.
002092 Take a good look to the chosen field. Making landing circuit is last chance for any plans.
002268 Left part of this field is longer but more bumpy. Right is still long enough for glider and much safer.
002419 We entered landing circuit.
002543 Just as in airfield circuit, make sure where glider and field is. Losing range to reach landing area is critical mistake.
002656 There it is...
002806 We are too high. Full airbrakes and side slip should handle it.
002841 To make sideslip, push stick to one side and push opposite rudder.  It makes drag higher, therefore increases sink.
002927 Keep wings level to the field surface.
002980 The rest is just as on airfield. If wing catches ground pull stick hard forward.
004541 Condor 2 does not simulate retrieving from field in sake of player's comfort. Now it is time to do some cross-country flying.
