000017 There are no visible thermals today, so it is good moment to ridge soaring lesson.
000145 Wind is blowing from the right to the left.
000190 Some lift is expected near slope. Let's go bit lower.
000297 Ridge is starting to lift us.
000391 Wind is strong, above 30 km/h so lift also works well.
000494 Remember that wind is pushing glider into slope. Keep nose drifted away from ground and keep reserve of airsped.
000634 Do not get pushed into ground. Watch your surroundings.
000820 Best lift is near slope and near top of it. With strong wind it works above mountain too, just weaker.
000852 Always turn from the slope, against the wind.
001042 If speed is the goal, there is no need to go higher. Big distances can be covered with great speeds while flying near top of the slope.
001165 We are going to fly downwind, going through lee side of slope. Extra altitude is nessessary.
001296 That high mountain is target. We need to pass turbulence and sink  first.
001527 It is better to fly fast and have 'plan B' in mountain areas with sink.
001762 Remember to start turn early enough, as glider has heavy tailwind.
001987 Using '4' key allows to see area of best ridge lift on PDA.
002164 Glider drift becomes clearly visible now. Once again, keep nose from pointing into slope.
002397 Conditions and lifts are good, but even 15-20km/h wind gives stable lift. On northen hemisphere, south ridges work generally better, because of sun operation.
002833 We are above top of the mountain. Lift will go weaker, but it is possible to get higher with strong wind.
003468 Windy days let us to go high not only on upwind slopes, and not only llittle above mountains tops, but this is topic of next lesson...
