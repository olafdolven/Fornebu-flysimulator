000023 Sun is shining directly on this one. It makes thermal stick to the slope and causes upslope winds.
000178 Lift is not strong, but still can be expected.
000261 We are not pushed into slope like with classic ridge soaring, but still it's good to have some speed reserve.
000403 Closer to ground we are, stronger the lift is. Make sure that safe distance is kept.
000714 Looks like there is regular thermal here.
000852 There is no regular wind, but we are too close to slope to make regular climb.
001157 Now let's try another slope.
001472 Sun position is good advice where to look for lifts.
001720 Once again, lift is not strong, but stable. It lets us to cover long distances without wind or climbing in thermals.
002110 When turning, rule is the same as on ridge soaring - always turn from the slope.
002241 Upslope wind is very narrow, lift goes under zero when we fly away a little from slope.
002558 Different sources of lift are adding or subtracting from themselves. South wind will work together with upslope one. Northen wind is disturbing it.
002722 Today, there should be some negative effect on shadowed side of slope from upslope wind.
003080 There is some sink. No lifts here.
003191 Upslope winds are following the sun. South slopes are working abut noon time. Later during the day, western ones are lifting and in the morning eastern slopes.
004440 Northen slopes work only in southern hemisphere. Nothing to do here.
