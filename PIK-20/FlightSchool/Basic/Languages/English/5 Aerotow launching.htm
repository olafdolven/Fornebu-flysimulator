<P>Again, make a good preflight check to prepare the plane and yourself for 
towing.</P>
<P>Press ESC and select "Ready for takeoff". The towplane will start it's engine 
and taxi in front of your glider.&nbsp;The wings will level and towplane will 
apply throttle. The&nbsp;glider will start to accelerate. Maintain direction and 
try to keep the wings level. This can be quite tricky as the commands are less 
responsive at low speeds.</P>
<P>When the speed reaches some 80 km/h (45 kts), gently pull the stick 
to&nbsp;lift the glider of the ground. Try to follow the towplane some 1 - 2 m 
(3 to 6 feet) above the ground until the towplane starts to climb. In 
aerotowing, the towplane should be located at your horizon or slightly 
above.</P>
<P>When turning, try to keep the same angle of bank as the towplane. Apply small 
but prompt corrections and follow the path of the towplane. If anything goes 
wrong, release immediately.</P>
<P>The towplane will tow you to your task starting point and then try to find 
thermals nearby. When you reach the desired altitude, the towplane will rock the 
wings, which is a sign you should release. Gear up and you are ready to start 
soaring.</P></BODY></HTML>
