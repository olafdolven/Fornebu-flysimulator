000045 Hello, difficult lesson today. Making circuit and landing.
000139 During whole flight it is important to watch outside, not only gauges.
000190 Before making each turn, make sure there is no traffic nearby on your way.
000303 Watch airfield and know glider position to make good landing circuit.
000379 Once again, space check before turn.
000590 When configuring to land, it is good idea to have trim set on 'heavy nose' position in most cases.
000620 Downwind leg is also good moment to make sure, that gear is down and blocked.
000884 Third and last turn should be made glider position on final is optimal.
001137 But always check if glider is not too far away from airfield.
001338 After last turn, glider should be aligned with runway.
001392 This is hard moment, glider is low and big part of focus is located on runway position.
001521 Is it good moment?
001604 Now, it looks like it.
001683 Wait with airbrakes after turn is finished.
001778 Best situation is when on half opened brakes, glider is aiming at beginning of runway.
001890 There is some crosswind so little bank to the left is nessessery.
002171 On whole final, speed should be around 100kmh. However it is better to have it too high than too slow.
002216 Just before touchdown, pull stick back a little, so glider flies around half meter over ground and smoothly loses speed.
002329 Keep wings level during rolling, do not forget about direction.
002644 The "eagle" has landed.
