<P>Winch launching can be hazardous if the plane and the pilot are not well 
prepared, so be sure to make a good pre-flight check first.</P>
<P>With commands centered, press ESC and select "Ready for takeoff". The wings 
will level and the winch will apply throttle. The&nbsp;glider will start to 
accelerate quite fast. Maintain wings level and when the speed reaches some 80 
km/h, gently pull the stick to pull of and gradually climb into a steeper 
angle.</P>
<P>For most gliders the speed in steady climb should be around 110 km/h (60 
kts). Maintain constant speed with wings level.</P>
<P>The climb angle will slowly become less steep as you reach the top of the 
climb. When the vertical speed drops below 1 m/s (2kts), pull the release 
handle. Gear up and you are ready to soar.</P></BODY></HTML>
