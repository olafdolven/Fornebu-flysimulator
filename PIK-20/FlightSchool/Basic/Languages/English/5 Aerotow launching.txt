000031 Next method of starting is using help of an airplane.
000081 Again, there is headwind and crosswind.
000175 Airbrakes retracted and locked, controls responsive, so tugplane can be called.
000274 Once again, it is good idea to trim the glider forward.
000454 During roll, keep wings leveled with ailerons and maintain course with rudder. It is the opposite of coordinated turn, because now hand and legs are working separetly.
000542 When airspeed is enough, gently pull glider in air and keep it low over ground until airplane will start.
000612 Now, just follow tail of airplane.
000812 When below the plane, airflow from proppeler will cause turbulence to the sailplane.
000893 During turn, keep bank angle the same as towplane and use rudded to follow its course.
001167 Getting above towplane is dangerous, because it is out of the sight and there is risk of hitting it when diving.
001213 Quick use of airbrakes is best way to handle this situation.
001328 On the opposite, getting low, however not advised, is not so risky to glider or towplane.
001476 Lets practice other unusual positions.
001599 Getting inside or outside of turning radious of towplane is also not advised. Being inside is bigger problem, because of lower airspeed of glider. 
001780 When outside, our airspeed rises, becaus of bigger radious of our turn. Rope can break in this situation.
001905 On the inside we risk losing control of our glider.
002227 Towplane sign to release is waving wings, but we can do it earlier.
002406 This is signal to release.
002437 After this, gently pull stick back, so collision with plane or rope is avoided.
002491 Make sure that airplane is flying away.
002567 Now rectract gear, trim glider as you wish and enjoy flying.
