000011 Hello, now there will be demonstration of winch launch.
000048 There is a little headwind and crosswind.
000114 Standard check of control respones is good thing to do.
000219 Trimmer should be positioned little on "heavy on nose" position.
000318 Now glider will start. 
000376 When speed is enough gently pull stick backwards.
000403 Speed is rising fast, so lets pull a little more.
000473 However, do not let airspeed drop, because nose is pointing at the sky!
000540 Around 110km/h is good.
000598 At the top, speed will decrease, so push the stick forward and get ready to release.
000674 Variometer shows that we are not gaining altitude so fast now.
000704 Press R to release from winch cable.
000757 And retract the gear.
000812 Winch launch is very dynamic way of starting. We gain about 500 meters of altitude very fast, but not much more should be expected.
000978 Next lesson is aerotow start.
