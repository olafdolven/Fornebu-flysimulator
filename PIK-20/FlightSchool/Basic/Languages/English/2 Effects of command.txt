000026 Hello, today lesson will teach about controls in glider. First one is pitch control. Moving stick forward pushes nose down, and pulling back - makes nose go up.
000133 This type of movement has big impact on airspeed, so look how it changes during manouver.
000266 With nose up too long, it is easy to lose airspeed, and stall the glider.
000342 Next, controlling bank angle. Moving stick left and right rotates glider. It is not effective without rudder, especially in big ships, like this Duo Discus.
000471 And the rudder, it makes mask go left or right, depending on which leg is pushed. Look again how instable glider is when using only this control.
000605 Proper method of steering using aileron and rudder is explained in next lesson.
000701 Now, the trimmer. It affects neutral position of elevator, so it has influence on nose position. Its purpose is to reduce load on stick, so flying is less exhausting.
000832 The last, airbrakes. Pulling them out causes big drag to the glider.
000953 Look how it affects sink rate, and what will happen when they retract.
001025 Sink lowered and airspeed immediately started to rise.
001188 That is enough for now.
