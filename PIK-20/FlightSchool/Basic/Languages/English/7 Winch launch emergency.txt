000029 For now, everything is standard: controls check, trimmer, brakes...
000175 Wind is quite strong, it will make our troubles bigger.
000231 There is cable break simulation planned at about 100 meters.
000303 Start as standard.
000424 Break! Pull nose down, keep calm and keep airspeed!
000473 Speed loss is immediate if You don't react fast enough.
000522 Now, lets split turning back into light right turn, to make place for bigger left one.
000660 First turn should be with the wind, and second against. This gives more time and mistake margin. 
000838 With tailwind, and higher groundspeed there is need to use full brakes on final. Glider will also roll longer after.
001096 Controls responsivness is also worse with tailwind.
001328 At last moments ailerons and rudder don't work at all. However we stopped where we started.
