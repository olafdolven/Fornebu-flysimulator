<P>Before You fly, You should get familiar with the glider. You start your flight at the airport runway, ready for takeoff. Take time to prepare yourself and the glider before takeoff. The pre-flight checklist should contain:</P>
<P><STRONG>1. Check the stick and rudder pedals</STRONG> </P>
<P>Move your stick and pedals to all directions to be sure that all of your controls are assigned correctly. </P>
<P><STRONG>2. Check flaps and airbrakes</STRONG></P>
<P>Flaps are already set to recommending takeoff setting. Airbrakes are retracted by default, but be sure to check the position of the airbrakes lever before start. In Duo Discus, the glider we will use to show lessons, You can’t control flaps. They are working with airbrakes, extending with them. But some other gliders, You will have to set flaps by yourself.</P>
<P><STRONG>3. Set altimeter </STRONG></P>
<P>Condor automatically sets your altimeter to QNH or QFE setting according to your choice in Setup->Options->Altimeter setting. Because of the air pressure fluctuations, you have to fine-tune the altimeter yourself. The default keys are “EQUALS” and “MINUS”.<STRONG> </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>4. Check trimmer </STRONG></P>
<P>In different gliders, trimmer is using different keys. Take in consideration the plane You fly, C/G bias, water load and start method, to set it good before take off.</P>
<P><STRONG> Check wind</STRONG> </P>
<P>Just before take off, take a look at the wind sock, usually located near the runway on your left side. Pay special attention to side- and tail-wind. If there is no wind sock, look at yaw string attached to canopy.</P>
<P>When you are ready, press ESCAPE button to bring up the Game menu and select 
‘Ready for takeoff’.</P>
<P>In real life flying, remember about closing and checking canopy locks!</P></BODY></HTML>
