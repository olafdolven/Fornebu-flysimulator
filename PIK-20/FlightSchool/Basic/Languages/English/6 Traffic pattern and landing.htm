<P>In soaring, traffic pattern is very important as the gliders don't have a 
second chance to land like motor planes if anything goes wrong. So traffic pattern 
should be&nbsp;your standard practice even if landing out.</P>
<P>When you start traffic pattern, you should be located parallel to the landing 
point some 300 - 500 m (yards) from the runway, around 200 m (600 feet) above 
the runway. At this point you should check that landing gear is down and then 
fly downwind parallel to the runway. Maintain at least 90 km/h (50 kts) 
throughout the pattern. In turbulent or unpredictable conditions add 10 to 20 
km/h (5 to 10 kts).</P>
<P>Traffic pattern should ideally look like rectangle from above. The task is to 
adapt the position of the two following turns so as to&nbsp;fly your final 
approach with half airbrakes open and land at the beginning of the runway. This, 
of course, takes some practice to master, especially in windy conditions.</P>
<P>When you approach the runway in the final approach, always try to&nbsp;fly on 
the line of the ideal glide angle, that is the angle with half brakes open that 
finishes at the beginning of the runway. This means that when you are low, you 
will retract the airbrakes to reach the ideal line as quickly as possible and 
vice versa. When you are on the ideal line, just keep airbrakes half open and 
maintain the speed.</P>
<P>When you are 5 to 10 m (15 to 30 feet) high, slowly pull the stick to level
the glider&nbsp;some 50 to 100 cm (2 feet)&nbsp;above the runway and then try to 
maintain that altitude for as long as possible to reduce the landing speed. When 
the speed is reduced, the glider will land by itself. Be careful to maintain the 
wings level when rolling out.</P></BODY></HTML>
