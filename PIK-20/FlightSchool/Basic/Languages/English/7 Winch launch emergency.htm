<p>Sometimes things just like to go wrong.</p>

<p>During a winch launch, cable sometimes can break, leaving the pilot with low speed, low altitude and nose pointed
into sky.</p>

<p>When this happens at the beginning of the launch (up to 50 meters), push stick forward, make sure that airspeed
is at least 90km/h and not dropping, and land ahead.</p>

<p>When this happens later,(at about 100 meters), push stick forward, make sure that airspeed is at least
90km/h, and not dropping. Then do gentle, about 30 degrees change of course to
the downwind side of runway. After this maintain straight flight for couple of
seconds, and turn back against the wind about 210 degrees until flying along
the runway. Then land, but remember about tailwind, so use more airbrakes,
because ground speed is higher.</p>

<p>When cable break happens
above 150 meters, just keep calm, keep airspeed, and do tight landing circuit,
with first two and last two turns are connected, so it is actually two 180
degrees circuit.</p>

<p>In this lesson, the second case will be flown.</p>
