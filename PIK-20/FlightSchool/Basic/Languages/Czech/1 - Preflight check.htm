<P>You start your flight at the airport runway, ready for takeoff. Take time to 
prepare yourself and the glider before takeoff. The pre-flight checklist should 
contain:</P>
<P><STRONG>1. Check the stick and rudder pedals</STRONG> </P>
<P>Move your stick and pedals to all directions to be sure that all of your 
controls are assigned correctly. </P>
<P><STRONG>2. Check flaps and airbrakes</STRONG></P>
<P>Flaps are already set to recommending takeoff setting. Airbrakes are 
retracted by default, but be sure to check the position of the airbrakes lever 
before start.</P>
<P><STRONG>3. Check trimmer </STRONG></P>
<P>Trimmer is set to neutral position on default. Depending on your C/G setting 
you may want to trim your glider up or down.<STRONG> </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>4. Check wind </STRONG></P>
<P>Take a look at the wind sock, usually located near the runway on your left 
side. Pay special attention to side- and tail-wind. </P>
<P><STRONG>5. Set altimeter</STRONG> </P>
<P>Condor automatically sets your altimeter to QNH or QFE setting according to 
your choice in Setup-&gt;Options-&gt;Altimeter setting. Because of the air 
pressure fluctuations, you have to fine-tune the altimeter yourself. The default 
keys are “EQUALS” and “MINUS”.</P>
<P>When you are ready, press ESCAPE button to bring up the Game menu and select 
‘Ready for takeoff’.</P></BODY></HTML>
